# This is an example DFB group config file
# lines starting with # are comments
# Also, anything after a # on a line is a comment
# Blank lines are ignored

# any options (except for MailTo) which are given before the first device section
# are considered to be global defaults, but they can be overridden on a
# per-device basis

MailTo=joel.chambers@polargroup.ca # Email address to mail diff-reports to
Type=cisco # default device type, corresponds to dfb-<type> script

# Example scp device definition
[scp1]
# This is a device definition.
# The letters inside the brackets are the device name and are part of filename bases
Host=localhost
# REQUIRED - this can be either a DNS hostname or an IPv4/IPv6 address

Type=scp
# In this case, the per-device Type line overrides the global default of "cisco"
# If the global default was "scp" you could safely leave this line out

Username=joel
# REQUIRED - this is the SSH/SFTP username of the remote device

Password=test
# NOT RECOMMENDED - this is the SSH/SFTP plaintext password for the remote device
# In order to use this option, you must have sshpass installed.  If you do not
# have sshpass installed, the script will fail with an error message.

SSHKey=/home/joel/.ssh/id_dsa
# RECOMMENDED - this is the path to a SSH identity file.
# If you have both Password and SSHKey lines the script
# will use the SSHKey line and print a warning

FilePath=/home/joel/testme
# REQUIRED - this is the path on the remote device to the
# monitored file.  You SHOULD use the full path

Debug=
# OPTIONAL - if this is set to anything except <blank> the script will print out full
# debug messages with options used

# Example cisco device definition
[cisco1]
Host=switch1
# REQUIRED - this can be either a DNS hostname or an IPv4/IPv6 address

#Type=scp
# In this case, because the global default is "cisco", this line is not required

Username=ciscouser
# MAY BE REQUIRED - this is the SSH/SFTP username of the remote device
# If your cisco device does not require a username (eg. telnet with no login local)
# you must leave this option out

Password=test
# REQUIRED - this is the Telnet/SSH plaintext password for the remote device
# If Username is set, then this is the corresponding password.  Otherwise it is
# the vty login password (NOT the enable password/secret)

Enable=enapass
# MAY BE REQUIRED - this is the enable password/secret of the remote device
# If your username logs in with enough privilege, this is not required.

Commands=sh run,sh chassis firm
# REQUIRED - this is a comma-separated list of commands to run on the remote device.
# Please make sure the login information provided above has enough privilege to run
# all of these commands.  They will be run in sequential order.

Debug=
# OPTIONAL - if this is set to anything except <blank> the script will print out full
# debug messages with options used
